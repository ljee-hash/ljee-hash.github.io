# Drawing Architecture Diagrams using the C4 Model

## **Drawing Architecture Diagrams using the C4 Model**

The C4 model is a standardized method for visualizing and describing software system architectures. It consists of four levels of views: system context, container, component, and code. To draw an architecture diagram using the C4 model, follow these steps:

1. Choose the right tool (e.g., Visio, Lucidchart, Draw.io, or hand-draw).
2. Determine the view you want to draw.
3. For each view:
   - System Context View: Draw your system in the center, and external systems and people around it, with arrows indicating data flow.
   - Container View: Mark each container, add a box with its name, and use arrows to show dependencies and interactions.
   - Component View: Mark each component, add a box with its name, and use arrows to show dependencies and interactions.
   - Code View: Mark each code element, add a box with its name, and use arrows to show dependencies and interactions.
4. Add annotations and details to enhance understanding.
5. Review and update the diagram as needed.

Remember to prioritize readability and understandability when drawing the diagram, as the C4 model aims to improve communication and understanding of software system architectures.


## **Complete example of a C4 model**

Here's a complete example of a C4 model architecture diagram for an e-commerce website:

**System Context View**

In this view, we see the e-commerce website (Online Store) at the center, surrounded by external systems and users that interact with it:
- Customers: They browse products, add items to their cart, and place orders.
- Payment Gateway: Handles payment processing for orders.
- Warehouse Management System: Manages inventory and shipping of products.

Arrows indicate the direction of data flow between these entities.

**Container View**

In this view, we see the high-level containers within the Online Store system:
- Web Application: Handles user interactions and displays products.
- Order Processing: Manages order fulfillment and inventory updates.
- Database: Stores product information, customer data, and order history.

Arrows show dependencies and interactions between containers.

**Component View**

In this view, we drill down into the components within each container:
- Web Application:
  - Product Catalog: Displays available products.
  - Shopping Cart: Allows customers to add and remove items.
  - Checkout: Guides customers through the order placement process.
- Order Processing:
  - Inventory Management: Updates stock levels.
  - Shipping Coordinator: Arranges product delivery.
- Database:
  - Product Database: Stores product details.
  - Customer Database: Stores customer information.
  - Order Database: Stores order history.

Arrows show dependencies and interactions between components.

**Code View**

In this view, we focus on specific code elements within each component:
- Product Catalog:
  - ProductRepository: Retrieves product data from the database.
  - ProductService: Provides product information to the web application.
- Shopping Cart:
  - CartController: Handles cart-related user interactions.
  - CartService: Manages the shopping cart state.
- Checkout:
  - CheckoutController: Guides customers through the checkout process.
  - PaymentGatewayAdapter: Communicates with the payment gateway.

Arrows show dependencies and interactions between code elements.

This C4 model example illustrates how to break down an e-commerce website's architecture into four levels of views, providing a clear understanding of the system's structure, components, and interactions.
