# Drawing Architecture Diagrams using the C4 Model

**Drawing Architecture Diagrams using the C4 Model**

The C4 model is a standardized method for visualizing and describing software system architectures. It consists of four levels of views: system context, container, component, and code. To draw an architecture diagram using the C4 model, follow these steps:

1. Choose the right tool (e.g., Visio, Lucidchart, Draw.io, or hand-draw).
2. Determine the view you want to draw.
3. For each view:
   - System Context View: Draw your system in the center, and external systems and people around it, with arrows indicating data flow.
   - Container View: Mark each container, add a box with its name, and use arrows to show dependencies and interactions.
   - Component View: Mark each component, add a box with its name, and use arrows to show dependencies and interactions.
   - Code View: Mark each code element, add a box with its name, and use arrows to show dependencies and interactions.
4. Add annotations and details to enhance understanding.
5. Review and update the diagram as needed.

Remember to prioritize readability and understandability when drawing the diagram, as the C4 model aims to improve communication and understanding of software system architectures.
